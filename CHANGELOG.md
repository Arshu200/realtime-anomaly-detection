## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-08

### Added
- **Complete project reorganization** following Python best practices
- **Professional directory structure** with clear separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive source code organization**:
  - `src/anomaly_detector/` - Core anomaly detection algorithms
  - `src/storage/` - Data storage and persistence layer
  - `src/monitoring/` - System monitoring and metrics collection
  - `src/utils/` - Common utilities and configuration management
- **Enhanced configuration management**:
  - Split configuration into specialized files (`influxdb_config.yaml`, `grafana_config.yaml`)
  - Centralized configuration loading and validation
- **Improved testing infrastructure**:
  - Organized test suite with unit and integration tests
  - Test fixtures and utilities for better test organization
- **Documentation structure**:
  - Comprehensive documentation in `docs/` directory
  - API reference, installation guide, and troubleshooting
- **Grafana resource organization**:
  - Structured dashboards, queries, and alert configurations
  - Ready-to-import dashboard and query templates
- **Development and deployment tools**:
  - Setup scripts for InfluxDB and dependencies
  - Docker configuration for containerized deployment
  - Example usage scripts and advanced configuration examples
- **Package infrastructure**:
  - Professional `setup.py` with proper metadata and dependencies
  - MIT License for open-source distribution
  - Entry points for command-line usage

### Changed
- **Moved main.py** to `src/` directory following Python package standards
- **Reorganized anomaly detection code** from flat structure to modular components
- **Improved import structure** with proper `__init__.py` files and clean interfaces
- **Enhanced storage layer** with abstract base classes for extensibility
- **Modularized monitoring components** for better separation of CPU monitoring and metrics collection

### Technical Improvements
- **Type hints and documentation** added throughout codebase
- **Modular design** with loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
- **Configuration flexibility** with environment-specific settings
- **Better error handling** and logging throughout the system
- **Professional package structure** ready for distribution

### Infrastructure
- **Docker support** for easy deployment and development
- **Comprehensive testing framework** with unit and integration tests
- **Documentation generation** support with Sphinx
- **Development tools** integration (pytest, black, flake8, mypy)

### Migration Notes
- **Import statements updated** to reflect new module structure
- **Configuration loading** enhanced to support multiple config files
- **File paths updated** throughout the codebase for new structure
- **Backward compatibility maintained** where possible
